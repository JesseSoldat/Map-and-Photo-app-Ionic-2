1. ionic cordova platform add android
2. ionic cordova run android

ionic cordova run android --device
ionic cordova platform add browser
ionic cordova run browser
--livereload


ionic serve runs your app as a website (meaning it doesn't have any Cordova capabilities)
ionic run browser runs your app in the Cordova browser platform, which will inject cordova.js and any plugins that have browser capabilities

This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myBlank blank
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myBlank` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
